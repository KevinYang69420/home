		<h2 class="question">What is Racism?</h2>
		<p id="definition">
		Racism, also called racialism, any action, practice, or belief that reflects the racial
		worldview—the ideology that humans may be divided into separate and exclusive biological
		entities called “races”; that there is a causal link between inherited physical traits
		and traits of personality, intellect, morality, and other cultural and behavioral features;
		and that some races are innately superior to others.

		<!--History of racism-->
		<h2 class="question">A brief history of racism<h2>
		<p>
		The first form of racism recorded was in between the 16th and 17th century when Christian
		religious hierarchy questioned whether Black and Indigenous people had souls and/or were human.
		Racism was also a major factor in slavery, colonization and empire-building activities of
		western Europeans, especially in the 18th century. At the time, race was widely used to differ
		Africans and Europeans by characterizing Africans as inferior beings. By the 19th century,
		racism had spread around the globe. Many leaders of countries started to use racism as a way
		of establishing superiority between races, which led to "lower" races being exploited for labour
		and discrimination by "higher" races. This continued on until 1948, when the Human Rights Decleration
		was set forth by the United Nations, which caused many people to understand that racism is wrong and
		denounce racist beliefs and practices. During the 1950s and 1960s, racial policies and laws were
		gradually eliminated in the US during the civil rights movement. Even so, racism hasn't been completely
		eradicated, and much of it is still practiced to this day.
